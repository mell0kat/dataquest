Further exploration:
- Review expulsions (which refers to when students are kicked out of school permanently). Columns like SCH_DISCWODIS_EXPWOE_HI_M and TOT_DISCWODIS_EXPZT_F contain information on expulsions.
- Explore gender and race differences in SAT scores. Columns like SCH_SATACT_HI_M contain this information.
- Figure out the racial and gender breakdowns for different types of schools, such as magnet schools.
- Determine how many students are in gifted and talented programs, or advanced placement classes.
- Investigate how racial differences in enrollment change from preschool to high school.
- Explore school bullying. The SCH_HBDISCIPLINED_DIS_HI_M column contains some of this information.
